as they may either attenuate acute respiratory syndrome and myocarditis or facilitate the access of the virus into the host.The article highlights the need for further studies to investigate the effects of RES on COVID-19 infection and the role of ACE2 in the disease.

but also risks increasing viral entry into the host.These findings highlight the complex interplay between ACE2
but the dual role of ACE2 in regulating RAS is not fully understood.* There are no available data on the strict relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV-2 mortality.* RES has shown anti-apoptotic effects in vitro against MERS-CoV infection.* Animal studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential therapeutic benefits of RES.Overall

which can lead to detrimental effects on the host

which down-regulates AT1R expression via up-regulation of ACE2. This mechanism could potentially mitigate the negative effects of RAS in COVID-19 patients.3. **Anti-apoptotic effect of RES**: Lin et al. have demonstrated that RES can inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells
